# Brazilian E-Commerce Data Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes a public dataset from Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce platform. The dataset comprises information about 100,000 orders made between 2016 and 2018 through multiple marketplaces in Brazil. By exploring various dimensions of the data, including order status, pricing, payment and delivery performance, customer locations, product attributes, and customer reviews, we gain valuable insights into the e-commerce business. Please note that the data has been anonymized, with company and partner references replaced by Game of Thrones great house names.

The dataset was generously provided by Olist, the largest department store in the Brazilian marketplace. Olist connects small businesses from across Brazil to sales channels seamlessly, offering them a single contract for hassle-free selling. Merchants can list their products on the Olist Store and utilize Olist's logistics partners for direct customer shipping. Learn more about Olist at [www.olist.com](https://www.olist.com).

## Business Questions

The project aims to answer key business questions. Such as:

- Total Orders and Total Sales: What is the total number of orders and total sales in the given period?
- Five Best-Selling Categories: What are the top five product categories with the highest sales volume?
- Five Best-Selling Products: What are the top five products with the highest sales?
- Highest-Rated Categories: What are the top five product categories with the highest average review scores?
- Monthly Sales Trends: What is the monthly sales trend over the dataset's time period?
- Orders by Day of the Week: How are orders distributed throughout the week?
- Average Delivery Time by State: What is the average delivery time for each state?
- On-Time Delivery Rate: What percentage of orders are delivered on or before the estimated delivery date?

## Usage

Now, after answering the business questions elaborated above through SQL, we will utilize Power BI to develop three comprehensive dashboards that will provide a final visualization of the analysis results. These dashboards are categorized into three main domains: Sales, Logistics, and Quality.

The **Sales Dashboard** offers insights into sales performance, showcasing key metrics and trends that allow stakeholders to make data-driven decisions. It provides information on top-selling products, revenue trends, and customer buying patterns.

The **Logistics Dashboard** focuses on the order fulfillment process, monitoring key logistics metrics such as delivery times, geographical distribution of customers, and on-time delivery rates. This enables the optimization of the supply chain and delivery operations.

The **Quality Dashboard** delves into customer feedback and satisfaction. It highlights the most well-received product categories, customer reviews, and overall customer experience ratings. By analyzing this information, we can identify areas for improvement to enhance customer satisfaction.
