# Brazilian E-Commerce Data Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes a public dataset from Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce platform. The dataset comprises information about 100,000 orders made between 2016 and 2018 through multiple marketplaces in Brazil. By exploring various dimensions of the data, including order status, pricing, payment and delivery performance, customer locations, product attributes, and customer reviews, we gain valuable insights into the e-commerce business. Please note that the data has been anonymized, with company and partner references replaced by Game of Thrones great house names.

The dataset was generously provided by Olist, the largest department store in the Brazilian marketplace. Olist connects small businesses from across Brazil to sales channels seamlessly, offering them a single contract for hassle-free selling. Merchants can list their products on the Olist Store and utilize Olist's logistics partners for direct customer shipping. Learn more about Olist at [www.olist.com](https://www.olist.com).

## Business Questions

The project aims to answer key business questions. Such as:

- Total Orders and Total Sales: What is the total number of orders and total sales in the given period?
- Five Best-Selling Categories: What are the top five product categories with the highest sales volume?
- Five Best-Selling Products: What are the top five products with the highest sales?
- Highest-Rated Categories: What are the top five product categories with the highest average review scores?
- Monthly Sales Trends: What is the monthly sales trend over the dataset's time period?
- Orders by Day of the Week: How are orders distributed throughout the week?
- Average Delivery Time by State: What is the average delivery time for each state?
- On-Time Delivery Rate: What percentage of orders are delivered on or before the estimated delivery date?
- Among the top 3 selling categories, who are the top 10 customers with the highest spending in each product category, and what is the total spending per category?
- Which products have seen a price increase of over 20% in the last three months of available data?
- What products have been purchased more than once in the same order, and what is the average frequency of such occurrences?
- Who are the top 10 customers with the most orders in the last 6 months, and what is the total revenue generated by these customers?
- What are the top 5 product categories that sold the most during the months October, November, December?
- Which products have experienced a significant increase in average ratings (more than 1 point) in the last three months?
- Which month has the highest sales revenue over the years, and which month has the lowest sales revenue?

## Data Analysis Using SQL

Data transformation is a crucial step in data analysis where SQL plays a pivotal role. Here's how data transformation is achieved through SQL:

- Aggregation: SQL allows for the aggregation of data. Functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG, and MAX are used to summarize and aggregate data. For instance, to calculate the total sales for a specific product or category, SQL queries with SUM are applied.

- Join Operations: SQL enables the combination of data from multiple tables through JOIN operations. This is vital for creating comprehensive datasets that incorporate data from various sources. For instance, merging customer data with transaction data to analyze customer behavior.

- Filtering: SQL provides the capability to filter data based on specific criteria. This is instrumental in focusing the analysis on relevant subsets of data. For example, filtering orders that meet certain conditions, such as orders above a certain value.

- Data Formatting: SQL can be used to standardize data formats. This is useful when dealing with dates, currencies, or other data types that need uniformity for analysis. SQL functions can transform data into consistent formats.

- Calculations: SQL allows for the creation of calculated fields. This is beneficial for deriving new insights from existing data. For instance, calculating profit margins by subtracting the cost from the sales price.

- Data Cleansing: While not the primary function of SQL, it can be used to clean data. SQL DELETE and UPDATE statements can be applied to remove duplicates, correct inaccuracies, or address missing values within the database.

_I addressed half of the business questions directly using PostgreSQL, and the SQL file for this is available in this repository. However, I segregated the remaining queries to be answered via SQLite within the Python environment to enhance the visualization of tables and integrate tools._

## Usage

Now, after answering the business questions elaborated above through SQL, we will utilize Power BI to develop three comprehensive dashboards that will provide a final visualization of the analysis results. These dashboards are categorized into three main domains: Sales, Logistics, and Quality.

The **Sales Dashboard** offers insights into sales performance, showcasing key metrics and trends that allow stakeholders to make data-driven decisions. It provides information on top-selling products, revenue trends, and customer buying patterns.

The **Logistics Dashboard** focuses on the order fulfillment process, monitoring key logistics metrics such as delivery times, geographical distribution of customers, and on-time delivery rates. This enables the optimization of the supply chain and delivery operations.

The **Quality Dashboard** delves into customer feedback and satisfaction. It highlights the most well-received product categories, customer reviews, and overall customer experience ratings. By analyzing this information, we can identify areas for improvement to enhance customer satisfaction.

These dashboards are instrumental for enhancing business operations and strategy, allowing for more informed and effective decision-making.  

# Final Reports

## Business Insights and Recommendations

As a Data Analyst, I've conducted a comprehensive analysis of our business data, and I'm pleased to present the following insights and recommendations:
